-   The code first checks if the "pacman" package is available using the **`require`** function. If it's not available, it installs the "pacman" package and then loads it using **`require`**.

-   The **`pacman::p_load`** function is used to load multiple packages at once. Each package listed is loaded, and if any of them are not installed, they will be installed (**`install = TRUE`**). Additionally, if newer versions of packages are available, they will be updated (**`update = TRUE`**).

-   Here's a brief explanation of each package:

    -   **`rstatix`**: Provides functions for statistical analysis, particularly for tidyverse users.

    -   **`tidyverse`**: A collection of packages (e.g., dplyr, ggplot2) for data manipulation and visualization.

    -   **`easystats`**: Provides easy-to-use functions for various statistical analyses.

    -   **`readr`**: Used for reading data from various file formats (e.g., CSV, Excel).

    -   **`magrittr`**: Provides the pipe operator (**`%>%`**) for easier data manipulation.

    -   **`knitr`**: Used for dynamic report generation, often in combination with R Markdown.

    -   **`report`**: A package for creating and formatting reports.

    -   **`scatr`**: Provides tools for exploratory data analysis and visualization.

    -   **`jmv`**: Contains tools for statistical analysis and hypothesis testing.

    -   **`performance`**: Provides functions for assessing model performance.

This code is an efficient way to ensure that all the necessary packages are available and up-to-date for your data analysis and reporting needs.

The next set of R codes above performs the following actions:

1.  Loads the built-in iris dataset and optionally allows you to view its summary using **`tibble::glimpse(iris)`**.

2.  You can uncomment the line **`# View(iris)`** to view the dataset in a separate window.

3.  Creates a scatter plot using **`ggplot2`** to visualize the relationship between Sepal.Length and Sepal.Width.

4.  Imports the iris dataset from a CSV file located at "data/iris.csv" into a variable called **`iris_import`** using the **`read_csv`** function from the **`readr`** package.

5.  Exports the original iris dataset to a CSV file at the specified file path.

6.  The last comment mentions that you can use **`getwd()`** to show your current working directory path.

Please note that some lines of code are commented out and can be uncommented when needed.

# Real-World Dataset Execises

In this exercise will perform a simple hypothesis test using real-world data set. Data used in this exercise was extracted from the mendeley database (Win, Kyaw (2023), "Aboveground Tree Carbon of Teak Plantations in West Bago Mountains, Myanmar", Mendeley Data, V1, doi: 10.17632/3xvcfskhwz.1): [Aboveground Tree Carbon of Teak Plantations in West Bago Mountains, Myanmar](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/3xvcfskhwz/1).

## Import and explore the dataset in Jamovi

Steps

1.  Open "Filtered.sav" file in Jamovi. The data should already be placed in the "data" sub-directory.

2.  Go to the "Variables" tab and remove the last four columns/ variables as we won't use them.

3.  Go to the "Data" tab and change the "Plantation_age" data/ measure type to "*ordinal*". ![Change data types](images/Screenshot%20from%202023-09-01%2012-48-46.png){width="180mm"}

4.  Navigate to the "Analyses" tab and from the "Exploration" button select "Descriptives". Use the functions from this window to explore the data set. ![Perform data exploration (descriptive) on the selected variable.](images/Screenshot%20from%202023-09-01%2012-55-58.png)

5.  You can further perform data exploration visually. Select the "scatterplot" from the "Exploration button and insert the appropriate variables to generate a scatterplot with linear fits along with density plots. ![Linear and density plots](images/Screenshot%20from%202023-09-01%2013-02-42.png)

## Performing hypothesis test in Jamovi

1.  Create a hypthesis to test based on the data set.

    1.  Ho: There are no differences in above ground tree carbon content among plantation ages.

    2.  Ha: There are differences in above ground tree carbon content among plantation ages.

2.  We decide that the appropriate statistical test required to test the above hypothesis is a two-way ANOVA since we are interested in the differences between plantation ages and also that the predictor/ explanatory variable has more than two sublevels.

3.  First, we perform normality test on the response variable 'Aboveground_Tree_Carbon_ton_per_ha_per_year' using the "shapiro-wilk" test. We see a significant effect (*p \< 0.001*) indicating that the variable is not normally distributed hence we have to select a non-parametric equivalent test and that would be the "Kruska-Wallis" test. ![Perform normality test on the responds variable.](images/Screenshot%20from%202023-09-01%2013-19-11.png)

4.  From the analysis tab, select the ANOVA button and select "Kruskal-Wallis" from the non-parametric section which is appropriate for this case. We found a significant effect of plantation age on the carbon content (p \< .001) indicating that there are signficant differences in carbon content between the plantation ages. A furthe pairwise comparison is needed to show where exactly do these differences exist between the plantation ages. ![Kruskal-Wallis test and pairwise comparison.](images/Screenshot%20from%202023-09-01%2013-36-15.png)

5.  Boxplots can be used to visually display the results. ![Boxplots.](images/Screenshot%20from%202023-09-01%2013-40-03.png)

# Interfacing Jamovi with R

Any analysis in Jamovi has an R interface which means that analysis or plots created in Jamovi has an R syntax. This syntax can be easily copied and used in R.

1.  To set this up, navigate to the far-right indicated by 3 vertical dots.

    ![3 dotts](images/Screenshot%20from%202023-09-01%2013-43-53.png)

2.  From the side pane, check the box for "Syntax mode".

    ![syntax mode](images/Screenshot%20from%202023-09-01%2013-45-41.png)

## Example:

### Plotting

1.  Create a scatter-plot. The syntax should automatically be included in the result section along with plot. Right-click on the syntax area and select syntax to copy for use in R.![syntax example](images/Screenshot%20from%202023-09-01%2014-04-49.png)
2.  In R, install and load the following packages: **`jmv`** and **`scatr`**. Furthermore, import the data set into R, paste the syntax copied over from Jamovi and run the syntax as shown below.

```{r jamovi syntax in R, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# Use pacman::p_load to load packages (jmv, scatr, jmvcore)
# with optional installation and no package updates
pacman::p_load(jmv, scatr, jmvcore, install = TRUE, update = FALSE)

# Import above-ground carbon data from a CSV or the SAV file
carbon <- readr::read_csv("./data/Filtered.csv")
carbon_spss_data <- haven::read_sav("./data/Filtered.sav")

# Syntax from the scatr package to create a scatterplot with linear regression lines
# This code visualizes the relationship between Tree Density, Aboveground Carbon, and Management Regime
scatr::scat(
    data = carbon,                                           # Specify the dataset (carbon)
    y = "Aboveground_Tree_Carbon_ton_per_ha_per_year",      # Choose the dependent variable (Y-axis)
    x = "Tree_Density_per_ha",                              # Choose the independent variable (X-axis)
    group = "Management_regime",                            # Group the data by Management Regime
    line = "linear",                                        # Add linear regression lines
    se = TRUE)                                              # Display standard error bars

```

Explanation:

-   **`pacman::p_load(jmv, scatr, jmvcore, install = TRUE, update = FALSE)`** is used to load three packages: **`jmv`**, **`scatr`**, and **`jmvcore`**. The **`install = TRUE`** parameter ensures that these packages are installed if they are not already installed, and **`update = FALSE`** prevents the packages from being updated.

-   **`carbon <- readr::read_csv("./data/Filtered.csv")`** reads data from a CSV file named "Filtered.csv" located in the "./data" directory and stores it in a variable called "carbon." This line imports the dataset needed for further analysis.

-   **`scatr::scat(...)`** is a function from the **`scatr`** package used to create a scatterplot with linear regression lines. The code specifies the dataset as "carbon," sets the Y-axis variable to "Aboveground_Tree_Carbon_ton_per_ha_per_year," sets the X-axis variable to "Tree_Density_per_ha," groups the data by "Management_regime," adds linear regression lines, and displays standard error bars. This code is used to visualize the relationship between Tree Density, Aboveground Carbon, and Management Regime in the dataset.

Note that plots created using the `scatr` package has limited functions to further tweak plots. A work around for this issue is to use the `ggplot2` package which has more customizable functions. An example is shown below.

```{r custom plot, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# Use pacman::p_load to load packages (ggthemes, ggplot2, patchwork)
# with optional installation and no package updates
pacman::p_load(ggthemes,
               ggplot2,
               patchwork,
               install = TRUE,
               update = FALSE)

# Import dataset from a CSV file
carbon <- readr::read_csv("./data/Filtered.csv")

# Create a customizable plot using ggplot2
plot1 <- ggplot2::ggplot(
  data = carbon,                                             # Specify the dataset (carbon)
  aes(                                                       # Define aesthetic mappings
    x = carbon$Tree_Density_per_ha,                         # X-axis variable
    y = carbon$Aboveground_Tree_Carbon_ton_per_ha_per_year,  # Y-axis variable
    col = carbon$Management_regime                           # Color by Management Regime
  )
) +
  ggplot2::geom_point(size = 3, pch = 21) +                  # Add points with custom size and shape
  ggplot2::geom_smooth(method = "lm") +                      # Add a linear regression line
  ggplot2::labs(x = "Tree density (ha)",                    # Set X-axis label
                y = "Above-ground tree carbon (tonne/ha/year)", # Set Y-axis label
                col = "Management Regime") +                 # Set legend title
  ggplot2::scale_x_continuous(limits = c(0, 1500)) +         # Set X-axis limits
  ggplot2::scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 6)) +            # Set Y-axis limits
  ggthemes::theme_base(base_size = 15, base_family = "times") +  # Apply custom theme settings
  ggplot2::theme(
    panel.grid.minor = element_line(size = 0.5, color = "grey"), # Customize minor grid lines
    axis.title = element_text(size = 20)                      # Customize axis title text
  )

# Print the customized plot
print(plot1)
```

Explanation:

-   **`pacman::p_load(...)`** is used to load three packages: **`ggthemes`**, **`ggplot2`**, and **`patchwork`**. The **`install = TRUE`** parameter ensures that these packages are installed if they are not already installed, and **`update = FALSE`** prevents the packages from being updated.

-   **`carbon <- readr::read_csv("./data/Filtered.csv")`** reads data from a CSV file named "Filtered.csv" located in the "./data" directory and stores it in a variable called "carbon." This line imports the dataset needed for plotting.

-   The **`ggplot2::ggplot(...)`** function is used to create a customizable plot. It specifies the dataset as "carbon" and defines aesthetic mappings, including X-axis, Y-axis, and color mapping based on the "Management_regime" column.

-   Various **`ggplot2::geom_`** functions are used to add geometrical elements to the plot, such as points and a linear regression line.

-   **`ggplot2::labs(...)`**, **`ggplot2::scale_...`**, and **`ggthemes::theme_...`** functions are used to customize plot labels, axis limits, and theme settings.

-   Finally, **`print(plot1)`** prints the customized plot to the output.

### Combine multiple plots

```{r combine plots, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

# Modify the first plot (plot1)
p1 <- plot1 +
  ggplot2::labs(x = "Tree density (ha)",         # Change the X-axis label
                y = "Above-ground tree carbon (tonne/ha/year)",  # Change the Y-axis label
                col = "")                         # Remove the color legend title

# Create another customizable plot using ggplot2
plot2 <- ggplot2::ggplot(
  data = carbon,                                           # Specify the dataset (carbon)
  aes(
    x = carbon$Management_regime,                         # X-axis variable
    y = carbon$Aboveground_Tree_Carbon_ton_per_ha_per_year  # Y-axis variable
  )
) +
  ggplot2::geom_boxplot(fill = "grey") +                  # Add a boxplot with grey fill
  ggplot2::labs(x = "Management Regime",                  # Set X-axis label
                y = "Above-ground tree carbon (tonne/ha/year)") +  # Set Y-axis label
  ggplot2::scale_y_continuous(limits = c(0, 6)) +         # Set Y-axis limits
  ggthemes::theme_base(base_size = 15, base_family = "times") +  # Apply custom theme settings
  ggplot2::theme(axis.title = element_text(size = 20))     # Customize axis title text

# Print the second plot (plot2)
print(plot2)

# Modify the second plot (plot2)
p2 <- plot2 + ggplot2::labs(x = "Management Regime",   # Change the X-axis label
                            y = "")                    # Remove the Y-axis label

# Combine both modified plots (p1 and p2) using the "&" operator
# Also, customize the legend position and add plot annotations
p1 + p2 &
  theme(
    legend.position = "bottom"                           # Customize legend position
  ) &
  patchwork::plot_annotation(
    tag_levels = "a", tag_prefix = "(", tag_suffix = ")"  # Add plot annotations with tags
  )
```

Explanation:

-   **`p1`** is created by modifying **`plot1`**. The X-axis label is changed, and the color legend title is removed.

-   **`plot2`** is created as a new customizable plot using **`ggplot2`**. It specifies the dataset and aesthetic mappings, creates a boxplot, and customizes the plot labels, axis limits, and theme settings.

-   **`p2`** is created by modifying **`plot2`**. The X-axis label is changed, and the Y-axis label is removed.

-   **`p1 + p2 & ...`** combines both modified plots **`p1`** and **`p2`** using the **`&`** operator. Additional customizations are applied to the combined plot, including changing the legend position and adding plot annotations with tags.

### Analyses Syntax

The following syntax and results (image) below were generated in Jamovi. Syntax is further modified in R.

![Analysis syntax and results from Jamovi.](images/Screenshot%20from%202023-09-01%2016-17-17.png)

```{r}

# Load necessary R packages using pacman
pacman::p_load(jmv,          # Load the jmv package for statistical analysis
               magrittr,     # Load the magrittr package for data manipulation
               install = TRUE,  # Install packages if not already installed
               update = FALSE   # Do not update packages if newer versions are available
)

# Perform Kruskal-Wallis test with pairwise comparisons
kruskal_pairwise <- jmv::anovaNP(
    formula = Aboveground_Tree_Carbon_ton_per_ha_per_year ~ Plantation_age,  # Specify the formula
    data = carbon,                        # Specify the dataset (carbon)
    pairs = TRUE                          # Perform pairwise comparisons
)

# Display the Kruskal-Wallis significance test results
kruskal_pairwise %>% print()
```

Explanation:

-   **`pacman::p_load(...)`** is used to load the required R packages, including **`jmv`** for statistical analysis and **`magrittr`** for data manipulation. The **`install`** parameter is set to **`TRUE`** to install the packages if they are not already installed, and **`update`** is set to **`FALSE`** to prevent updating packages.

-   **`kruskal_pairwise`** stores the result of the Kruskal-Wallis test with pairwise comparisons. It calculates the Kruskal-Wallis test for the specified formula and dataset, and the **`pairs = TRUE`** argument indicates that pairwise comparisons should be performed.

-   **`kruskal_pairwise %>% print()`** is used to display the Kruskal-Wallis significance test results directly without the need to extract them into a data frame.

## **Hypothesis Testing: Parametric and Non-Parametric Tests**

-   Understanding the Foundations of Statistical Testing

### **Introduction**

-   Importance of hypothesis testing in forestry and ecology:

    -   Hypothesis testing helps researchers in forestry and ecology validate theories, make informed decisions about conservation efforts, and understand the impact of environmental factors.

### **Key Concepts**

-   Definition of null and alternative hypotheses:

    -   Null Hypothesis (H0): There is no significant difference in the average height of oak trees between Site A and Site B.

    -   Alternative Hypothesis (H1): There is a significant difference in the average height of oak trees between Site A and Site B.

-   Explanation of the significance level (alpha):

    -   Set at 0.05, it signifies a 5% chance of rejecting the null hypothesis when it's true.

-   Introducing p-values and their interpretation:

    -   A p-value of 0.03 indicates that there's a 3% probability that the observed difference occurred by chance.

-   Type I and Type II errors:

    -   In ecology, a Type I error could involve incorrectly identifying a species as invasive when it's not. A Type II error might mean failing to detect a critically endangered species.

### **Parametric vs. Non-Parametric Tests**

-   Difference between parametric and non-parametric tests:

    -   Parametric tests assume the data follows a specific distribution.

    -   Non-parametric tests are distribution-free and more robust to deviations from normality.

-   Examples in forestry and ecology:

    -   Parametric: Testing if there's a difference in the mean chlorophyll levels between two groups of plant species.

    -   Non-parametric: Comparing the diversity of aquatic invertebrate species in different river habitats.

### **Parametric Tests**

-   When to use parametric tests:

    -   Use parametric tests when data is normally distributed and meets test assumptions.

-   Common parametric tests with forestry/ecology examples:

    -   t-test: Comparing the mean annual precipitation in two different forest ecosystems.

    -   ANOVA: Assessing if there's a significant difference in bird species richness among three different forest types.

    -   Linear Regression: Investigating the relationship between temperature and tree growth in a specific forest region.

### **Non-Parametric Tests**

-   When to use non-parametric tests:

    -   Use non-parametric tests when data doesn't meet parametric assumptions (e.g., non-normality).

-   Common non-parametric tests with forestry/ecology examples:

    -   Mann-Whitney U test: Comparing the diversity of fungi species in two different soil types.

    -   Kruskal-Wallis test: Testing if there's a difference in plant height across various altitudinal zones.

    -   Wilcoxon signed-rank test: Assessing changes in insect abundance before and after a controlled burn in a grassland ecosystem.

### **Choosing the Right Test**

-   Considerations for choosing between parametric and non-parametric tests in forestry and ecology:

    -   Emphasize that test choice depends on data characteristics, research questions, and assumptions.

### **Practical Example**

-   Real-world example:

    -   Research Question: *Does the average tree canopy cover differ significantly between a logged forest and an old-growth forest?*

    -   Data: Canopy cover measurements from both forest types.

    -   Hypotheses: H0: *No difference in canopy cover. H1: Significant difference in canopy cover.*

    -   Perform a t-test or Mann-Whitney U test (based on data distribution) using R or Jamovi.

    -   Interpret results and assess whether to reject the null hypothesis.

### **Summary**

-   Hypothesis testing is a fundamental tool for making data-driven decisions in forestry and ecology.

-   Test choice depends on data characteristics and research objectives.

-   Correct hypothesis formulation and test selection are crucial for meaningful results.

## **Confidence Intervals, p-values Interpretation, and Correlation Test**

-   Unraveling the Mysteries of Statistical Inference

### **Introduction**

-   Importance of understanding confidence intervals, p-values, and correlation tests in forestry and ecology:

    -   These concepts are fundamental for drawing conclusions from data and assessing relationships in ecological and environmental research.

### **Confidence Intervals**

-   Definition of a confidence interval:

    -   A confidence interval provides a range within which the true population parameter is likely to fall.

-   Interpretation:

    -   A 95% confidence interval means that if we were to sample repeatedly and construct intervals, we expect about 95% of those intervals to contain the true parameter.

-   Example: Confidence interval for the average tree height in a forest.

### **Constructing Confidence Intervals**

-   Steps for constructing a confidence interval:

    1.  Collect sample data.

    2.  Calculate sample statistics (e.g., mean and standard error).

    3.  Determine the confidence level (e.g., 95%).

    4.  Calculate the margin of error.

    5.  Formulate the confidence interval.

-   Example: Calculating a 95% confidence interval for the mean plant biomass in a wetland ecosystem.

### **p-values Interpretation**

-   Explanation of p-values:

    -   A p-value represents the probability of obtaining results as extreme as the observed results, assuming the null hypothesis is true.

-   Interpretation:

    -   A small p-value (typically \< 0.05) suggests that there's strong evidence against the null hypothesis.

-   Example: Interpreting a p-value in a study investigating the effect of pollution on amphibian populations.

-   Common thresholds for p-values:

    -   p \< 0.05: Strong evidence to reject the null hypothesis.

    -   p ≥ 0.05: Insufficient evidence to reject the null hypothesis.

-   Example: Evaluating p-values in a study assessing the impact of fire frequency on plant species diversity.

### **Correlation Test**

-   Definition of correlation:

    -   Correlation measures the strength and direction of a linear relationship between two variables.

-   Types of correlation tests:

    -   Pearson correlation coefficient (for linear relationships).

    -   Spearman rank correlation (for non-linear relationships).

-   Example: Examining the correlation between temperature and the number of bird species in a region.

### **Interpreting Correlation Coefficients**

-   Interpretation of correlation coefficients:

    -   Positive correlation: As one variable increases, the other tends to increase.

    -   Negative correlation: As one variable increases, the other tends to decrease.

    -   Zero correlation: No linear relationship between variables.

-   Example: Interpreting a positive correlation between rainfall and plant growth.

### **Practical Example**

-   Real-world example:

    -   Research Question: *Is there a significant correlation between tree canopy density and the number of bird species in a forest?*

    -   Collect canopy density and bird species data.

    -   Perform a correlation test (e.g., Pearson or Spearman) using R or Jamovi.

    -   Interpret the results to assess the strength and direction of the relationship.

### **Summary**

-   Confidence intervals provide a range for population parameters.

-   p-values help assess the strength of evidence against the null hypothesis.

-   Correlation tests quantify the relationship between variables.
