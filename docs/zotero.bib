A critical part of the work of statisticians, data scientists, and analysts is summarizing data sets and regression models in R and publishing or sharing polished summary tables. The gtsummary package was created to streamline these everyday analysis tasks by allowing users to easily create reproducible summaries of data sets, regression models, survey data, and survival data with a simple interface and very little code. The package follows a tidy framework, making it easy to integrate with standard data workflows, and offers many table customization features through function arguments, helper functions, and custom themes.},

	abstract = {Individual tree detection ({ITD}) and crown delineation are two of the most relevant methods for extracting detailed and reliable forest information from {LiDAR} (Light Detection and Ranging) datasets. However, advanced computational skills and specialized knowledge have been normally required to extract forest information from {LiDAR}. The development of accessible tools for 3D forest characterization can facilitate rapid assessment by stakeholders lacking a remote sensing background, thus fostering the practical use of {LiDAR} datasets in forest ecology and conservation. This paper introduces the treetop application, an open-source web-based and R package {LiDAR} analysis tool for extracting forest structural information at the tree level, including cutting-edge analyses of properties related to forest ecology and management. We provide case studies of how treetop can be used for different ecological applications, within various forest ecosystems. Specifically, treetop was employed to assess post-hurricane disturbance in natural temperate forests, forest homogeneity in industrial forest plantations and the spatial distribution of individual trees in a tropical forest. treetop simplifies the extraction of relevant forest information for forest ecologists and conservationists who may use the tool to easily visualize tree positions and sizes, conduct complex analyses and download results including individual tree lists and figures summarizing forest structural properties. Through this open-source approach, treetop can foster the practical use of {LiDAR} data among forest conservation and management stakeholders and help ecological researchers to further understand the relationships between forest structure and function.},

In many applications, spatial clustering in unobserved risk factors across nearby units can also affect their survival rates and odds of becoming immune. To address these methodological challenges, this article introduces our {BayesSPsurv} R-package, which fits parametric Bayesian Spatial split-population survival (cure) models that can account for spatial autocorrelation in both subpopulations of the user’s time-to-event data. Spatial autocorrelation is modeled with spatially weighted frailties, which are estimated using a conditionally autoregressive prior. The user can also fit parametric cure models with or without nonspatial i.i.d. frailties, and each model can incorporate time-varying covariates. {BayesSPsurv} also includes various functions to conduct pre-estimation spatial autocorrelation tests, visualize results, and assess model performance, all of which are illustrated using data on post-civil war peace survival.},

Automating the process of generating documents for data descriptions, summaries, exploration, and analysis allows the statistician to provide a more comprehensive view of the information captured by a clinical trial, and efficient generation of these documents allows the statistican to focus more on the conceptual development of a trial or trial analysis and less on the implementation of the summaries and results on which decisions are made.

	shorttitle = {Analysing censored data in agricultural research},
	abstract = {Metric data are usually assessed on a continuous scale with good precision, but sometimes agricultural researchers cannot obtain precise measurements of a variable. Values of such a variable cannot then be expressed as real numbers (e.g., 1.51 or 2.56), but often can be represented by intervals into which the values fall (e.g., from 1 to 2 or from 2 to 3). In this situation, statisticians talk about censoring and censored data, as opposed to missing data, where no information is available at all. Traditionally, in agriculture and biology, three methods have been used to analyse such data: (a) when intervals are narrow, some form of imputation (e.g., mid-point imputation) is used to replace the interval and traditional methods for continuous data are employed (such as analyses of variance [{ANOVA}] and regression); (b) for time-to-event data, the cumulative proportions of individuals that experienced the event of interest are analysed, instead of the individual observed times-to-event; (c) when intervals are wide and many individuals are collected, non-parametric methods of data analysis are favoured, where counts are considered instead of the individual observed value for each sample element. In this paper, we show that these methods may be suboptimal: The first one does not respect the process of data collection, the second leads to unreliable standard errors ({SEs}), while the third does not make full use of all the available information. As an alternative, methods of survival analysis for censored data can be useful, leading to reliable inferences and sound hypotheses testing. These methods are illustrated using three examples from plant and crop sciences.},

Despite the development of new methods involving computational programming and machine learning algorithms, higher accuracy is still needed for species identification, which is why we present herein the new {SoundShape} package for R platform. The new package focuses on implementing the eigensound method, a promising, and yet little explored protocol for bioacoustical analysis. The eigensound function is the main feature of {SoundShape}, allowing its user to convert sound waves into a dataset that can be analysed similar to coordinate sets from Geometric Morphometrics Methods, thus enabling the direct comparison between stereotyped calls from different species. Besides, {SoundShape} also features complementary functions for basic analysis of quantitative variation and illustration of hypothetical sound shapes representing the sample of sounds. Implementation of {SoundShape} is summarized through a workflow guide, using data from the new package. The sample study resulted in nearly 90\% variation expressed in an ordination plot, therefore successfully summarizing complex sound waves previously described by large datasets of amplitude values. Moreover, we also introduce two addendums to eigensound: (a) three steps to prevent errors and biased results—aimed at securing a meaningful comparison between acoustic units from different species; and (b) the option of applying a logarithmic grid on the x-axis (time)—which emphasizes short duration calls while also encompassing long ones. {SoundShape} package now provide the tools required for anyone to replicate and implement the eigensound method on the r platform. This will enable future studies to focus on further exploring the applications of sound shape analysis on various scientific areas, including (but not limited to) taxonomy, systematics, evolution, acoustic niche partitioning, soundscape ecology and machine learning algorithms focused on species identification for conservation biology.},

	abstract = {Advances in network ecology offer new tools for the sustainable management of agroecosystems. Plants in field margins may be involved in different processes of agronomic importance - indirectly affecting crops by supporting shared pollinators, hosting natural enemies of pests or acting as pest reservoirs. In this work, we explored the use of motifs (patterns of interaction between a subset of species) in agricultural ecological networks incorporating multiple types of trophic interactions to identify plant species with a key role in field margins. We searched for plant species benefiting crops via (1) shared pollinators and (2) supporting parasitoids of crop pests; or (3) negatively affecting crops through attracting pest herbivore species. We focused on determining whether species’ showed consistent affiliation with these roles across the landscape and evaluated the potential of plant species to influence crops indirectly via shared insect partners. To showcase our framework, we used a unique data set of antagonistic and mutualistic interactions recorded in soybean crops and wild plant species in field margins, that despite its limitations (e.g., spanning one growing season) allowed us to test our approach using multiple types of interactions simultaneously. Here, we support the use of motifs in multi-trophic interaction networks in agroecosystems to reveal the role of key plant species in sustaining ecological functions involving crops and other plant species, enhancing the evidence base for management recommendations in the future.},

Based on a systematic search, we screened more than 140 R packages related to {DQA} in the Comprehensive R Archive Network. From these, we selected packages which target at least three of the four {DQ} dimensions (integrity, completeness, consistency, accuracy) in a reference framework. We evaluated the resulting 27 packages for general features (e.g., usability, metadata handling, output types, descriptive statistics) and the possible assessment’s breadth. To facilitate comparisons, we applied all packages to a publicly available dataset from a cohort study. We found that the packages’ scope varies considerably regarding functionalities and usability. Only three packages follow a {DQ} concept, and some offer an extensive rule-based issue analysis. However, the reference framework does not include a few implemented functionalities, and it should be broadened accordingly. Improved use of metadata to empower {DQA} and user-friendliness enhancement, such as {GUIs} and reports that grade the severity of {DQ} issues, stand out as the main directions for future developments.},

	abstract = {Nonlinear regression models are important tools because many crop and soil processes are better represented by nonlinear than linear models. Fitting nonlinear models is not a single-step procedure but an involved process that requires careful examination of each individual step. Depending on the objective and the application domain, different priorities are set when fitting nonlinear models; these include obtaining acceptable parameter estimates and a good model fit while meeting standard assumptions of statistical models. We propose steps in fitting nonlinear models as described by a flow diagram and discuss each step separately providing examples and updates on procedures used. The following steps are considered: (i) choose candidate models, (ii) set starting values, (iii) fit models, (iv) check convergence and parameter estimates, (v) find the “best” model among competing models, (vi) check model assumptions (residual analysis), and (vii) calculate statistical descriptors and confidence intervals. The associated feedback mechanisms are also addressed (i.e., model variance homogeneity). In particular, we emphasize the first step (choose candidate models) by providing an extensive library of nonlinear functions (77 equations with the associated parameter meanings) and examples of typical applications in agriculture. We hope that this contribution will clarify some of the difficulties and confusion with the task of using nonlinear models.},

	abstract = {Phylogenetic trees and data are often stored in incompatible and inconsistent formats. The outputs of software tools that contain trees with analysis findings are often not compatible with each other, making it hard to integrate the results of different analyses in a comparative study. The treeio package is designed to connect phylogenetic tree input and output. It supports extracting phylogenetic trees as well as the outputs of commonly used analytical software. It can link external data to phylogenies and merge tree data obtained from different sources, enabling analyses of phylogeny-associated data from different disciplines in an evolutionary context. Treeio also supports export of a phylogenetic tree with heterogeneous-associated data to a single tree file, including {BEAST} compatible {NEXUS} and jtree formats; these facilitate data sharing as well as file format conversion for downstream analysis. The treeio package is designed to work with the tidytree and ggtree packages. Tree data can be processed using the tidy interface with tidytree and visualized by ggtree. The treeio package is released within the Bioconductor and {rOpenSci} projects. It is available at https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/treeio/.},

Tree search may be conducted using equal or implied step weights with an explicit (albeit inexact) allowance for inapplicable character entries, avoiding some of the pitfalls inherent in standard parsimony methods. Profile parsimony and user-specified optimality criteria are supported.
A graphical interface, which requires no familiarity with R, is designed to help a user to improve the quality of datasets through critical review of underpinning character codings; and to obtain additional information from results by identifying and summarizing clusters of similar trees, mapping the distribution of trees, and removing ‘rogue’ taxa that obscure underlying relationships.
Taken together, the package aims to support methodological rigour at each step of data collection, analysis, and the exploration of phylogenetic results.},

	abstract = {{DNA} metabarcoding is a powerful tool to assess biodiversity by amplifying and sequencing a standardized gene marker region. Its success is often limited due to variable binding sites that introduce amplification biases. Thus, the development of optimized primers for communities or taxa under study in a certain geographic region and/or ecosystems is of critical importance. However, no tool for obtaining and processing of reference sequence data in bulk that can serve as a backbone for primer design is currently available. We developed the r package {PrimerMiner}, which batch downloads {DNA} barcode gene sequences from {BOLD} and {NCBI} data bases for specified target taxonomic groups and then applies sequence clustering into operational taxonomic units ({OTUs}) to reduce biases introduced by the different number of available sequences per species. Additionally, {PrimerMiner} offers functionalities to evaluate primers in silico, which are in our opinion more realistic than the strategy employed in another available software for that purpose, {ecoPCR}. We used {PrimerMiner} to download cytochrome c oxidase subunit I ({COI}) sequences for 15 important freshwater invertebrate groups, relevant for ecosystem assessment. By processing {COI} markers from both data bases, we were able to increase the amount of reference data 249-fold on average, compared to using complete mitochondrial genomes alone. Furthermore, we visualized the generated {OTU} sequence alignments and describe how to evaluate primers in silico using {PrimerMiner}. With {PrimerMiner}, we provide a useful tool to obtain relevant sequence data for targeted primer development and evaluation. The {OTU}-based reference alignments generated with {PrimerMiner} can be used for manual primer design or processed with bioinformatic tools for primer development.},

	abstract = {Camera trapping is a widely applied method to study mammalian biodiversity and is still gaining popularity. It can quickly generate large amounts of data which need to be managed in an efficient and transparent way that links data acquisition with analytical tools. We describe the free and open-source R package {camtrapR}, a new toolbox for flexible and efficient management of data generated in camera trap-based wildlife studies. The package implements a complete workflow for processing camera trapping data. It assists in image organization, species and individual identification, data extraction from images, tabulation and visualization of results and export of data for subsequent analyses. There is no limitation to the number of images stored in this data management system; the system is portable and compatible across operating systems. The functions provide extensive automation to minimize data entry mistakes and, apart from species and individual identification, require minimal manual user input. Species and individual identification are performed outside the R environment, either via tags assigned in dedicated image management software or by moving images into species directories. Input for occupancy and (spatial) capture-recapture analyses for density and abundance estimation, for example in the R packages unmarked or secr, is computed in a flexible and reproducible manner. In addition, survey summary reports can be generated, spatial distributions of records can be plotted and exported to gis software, and single- and two-species activity patterns can be visualized. {camtrapR} allows for streamlined and flexible camera trap data management and should be most useful to researchers and practitioners who regularly handle large amounts of camera trapping data.},

	abstract = {Convolutional neural networks ({CNNs}) and deep learning are powerful and robust tools for ecological applications. {CNNs} can perform very well in various tasks, especially for visual tasks and image data. Image segmentation (the classification of all pixels in images) is one such task and can for example be used to assess forest vertical and horizontal structure. While such methods have been suggested, widespread adoption in ecological research has been slow, likely due to technical difficulties in implementation of {CNNs} and lack of toolboxes for ecologists.Here, we present R package imageseg which implements a workflow for general-purpose image segmentation using {CNNs} and the U-Net architecture in R. The workflow covers data (pre)processing, model training, and predictions. We illustrate the utility of the package with two models for forest structural metrics: tree canopy density and understory vegetation density. We trained the models using large and diverse training data sets from a variety of forest types and biomes, consisting of 3288 canopy images (both canopy cover and hemispherical canopy closure photographs) and 1468 understory vegetation images.Overall classification accuracy of the models was high with a Dice score of 0.91 for the canopy model and 0.89 for the understory vegetation model (assessed with 821 and 367 images, respectively), indicating robustness to variation in input images and good generalization strength across forest types and biomes.The package and its workflow allow simple yet powerful assessments of forest structural metrics using pre-trained models. Furthermore, the package facilitates custom image segmentation with multiple classes and based on color or grayscale images, e.g. in cell biology or for medical images. Our package is free, open source, and available from {CRAN}. It will enable easier and faster implementation of deep learning-based image segmentation within R for ecological applications and beyond.},
